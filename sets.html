    <h1>We get sets of Clubs!</h1>
      <p>Heat up your golf game with the Hawaiian sticks. The deep central undercut channel increases the amount of clubface flexing and rebound for increased ball speed and more distance. A stabilizing arch reinforces the clubface creating excellent sound while maintaining superior feel. Perimeter weighting enlarges the club's sweet spot providing additional forgivness, higher launch angles and incredible stopping power.<hr>

      <p>I have had the same set of Irons for several years, nice generic set. I finally started consistently hitting in the low 80's but could never break that 80 mark. I decided that my game could use some help so I went into the store and hit several clubs for 2 hours. Ended up feeling the most comfortable and consistent with these clubs. I do however have to adjust my club choice as I hit these clubs higher and further then my own. The one thing that I really like, that the pro helped me understand, is the feel these clubs give me, I know right away if I hit a good shot or bad shot without looking at the ball flight. The feed back these clubs give you is fantastic.</p><hr>
      <p>Great irons. I was looking for a solid set for a reasonable price, as I'm no pro, and I don't play three times a week. These irons are a fantastic mix of performance, playability, and forgiveness. For a guy like me who expects to play well each time, but understands that I don't play enough to hit the top-notch blade irons, these Hawaiian sticks are exactly what I need to play well without spending hours on the range each day. These irons will help you improve your game, while being versatile enough to perform the tougher shots that pure "game improvement" irons aren't made to make.</p>
